Hedge Project
==========

## What is it

**Hedging** is an important aspect of portfolio management. Portfolio 
managers are often required to stay within risk limits; for example, 
they cannot let their volatility be to high or value-at-risk so low. 
Also, there are times when market conditions lead them to reduce the 
risk of their portfolio. Hedging is the primary mechanism through which 
they carry out these tasks. This project provie several ideas about how to 
hedging, different ways to hedging(minimun variance, VaR, CVaR, etc.), and 
the performance of hedging.
